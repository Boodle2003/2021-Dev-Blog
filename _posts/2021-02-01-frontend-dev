Front-end web development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for websites so that they can be seen and interacted with.
The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly.
Therefore, the developer needs to be aware of that.
Websites are designed to ensure that it is in a format that is easy to understand. 
This is complicated due to the amount of use for the internet.

I intend to develop games, animation, and music for everyone to enjoy. I will learn to improve those skills later on.

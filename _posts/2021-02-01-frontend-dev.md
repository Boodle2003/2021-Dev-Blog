Front-end web development is a method of development for websites. 
It is often complicated because the tools and techniques of development are updated constantly.
Frontend development manages what is seen the moment people enter the site.
The goal of these developers is to design a front end that is easy to read and use.
This helps a lot for the amount of users online.

I intend to develop games, animation, and music for everyone to enjoy. I will learn to improve those skills later on.

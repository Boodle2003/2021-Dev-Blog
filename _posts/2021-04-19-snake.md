As my snake gets more and more sophisticated, I realize that work comes before games. O
ther than that, things have gone smoothly. 
We are fixing bugs, editing our snake and teaching ourselves to do better. 
I have been overseeing the project and finding tweaks. 
The snake is still working well, but there were a few bugs we needed to fix. 
I look forward to competing on Battlesnake! 
In the meantime, I will resort to homemade animation and voice acting.

Best wishes!

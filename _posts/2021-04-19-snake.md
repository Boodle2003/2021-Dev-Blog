The snake didn't make the lead, but we did manage to make it playable.
At first, it was hard to control and maintain, but in the end, it turned out okay.
I was the producer of the project, making sure things didn't go wrong throughout development.
We figured out how to program a snake to do our biding, then fixed any errors there were in the system.
We will continue working on it, because that seems like the right thing to do.
